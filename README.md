# Data-transceiver-using-SPARQL
  This is an implementation of how to transfer and manipulate data between the Arduino chip and the c-sharp program using the serial port and SPARQL.
  SPARQL is an RDF query language—that is, a semantic query language for databases—able to retrieve and manipulate data stored in Resource Description Framework format.
